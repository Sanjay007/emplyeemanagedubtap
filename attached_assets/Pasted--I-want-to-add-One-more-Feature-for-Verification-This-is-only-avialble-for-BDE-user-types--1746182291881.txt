I want to add One more Feature for Verification :-

This is only avialble for BDE user types , other User types can view the Reports in same way  as we did for Sales Reports .
We need an option for Add Verificication Report which will have below fields :-

Verification Form Fields

1. Merchant Name
2. Registered Mobile Number
3. Business Name
4. Full Address

5 Media Uploads:
- 6 Upload Verification Video (Max 60 seconds, camera opens on click)
- 7 Upload Shop Photo
- 8 Upload Shop Owner Photo
- 9 Aadhaar Card Photo
- 10 PAN Card Photo
- 11 Store Outside Photo
 For All media inputs open camera directly when clicked on mobile and also give option to upload as well .
 
Once The Form is submnitted the Status of Verification will be pending . 
The Verification data can go to approve or reject by admin . If its approved it will not show in BDE dashboard screen of verification .
If rejected Show rejection resaon and add a field for rejection reason in admin .
 If Status = "Rejected" 
•	Show massage Why reject  Show "Edit Info" button
•	On click, It will open  same Verification Form but with:
		o	All previously submitted data pre-filled
		o	BDE can edit/update and resubmit
		o	On submission by BDE , status is set back to Pending for re-verification

In case of admin login, the verification report screen will be different, it will show the count of pending , accepted and rejected verifications .
🔍 Filter Options
•	📅 Filter by Date Range (Calendar)
•	🔍 Search by Name or Mobile Number
•	✅ Filter by Verification Status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
•	📥 Download Report (without media) (Excel/PDF format)

We need to Show the list of all Verifications Report and Details as well . 
Admin Actions Functionality
•	✅ Approve Button: Instantly updates status to Approved.
•	❌ Reject Button: Opens popup to Add Remark → Submit → Status becomes Rejected.
•	📂 Download Without Media: Download only text data (without photos/videos).

The Verification Video Should be of Max 60 Seconds and it should be captured from camera . 
All Photos below Should be Captured By Camera .

In Case oF Manager and BDM login for Verification Report the Data Shown will be different :-
Verification Report Table will have (Restricted View) . Manager and BDM can't approve the Verification Report . A Manager can Only see Reports of His BDM and BDE Under Him . Similarly a BDM can only View Reports Of BDE Under Him .
